# Date Range Selector Module for Bootstrap, v4

A customizable date range selector for bootstrap, v4

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You must include the following css & js files inside your html document:

```
css/daterangepicker.css
```
```
js/daterangepicker.js
js/moment.js
js/moment.min.js
```


### Installing
Installing the date range selector is as simple as including the css and javascript references (drop-in place)

For the css:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/daterangepicker.css" />
```

And for the javascript:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/moment.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/daterangepicker.js"></script>
```

Don't forget you'll need to include the regular bootstrap and jquery libraries too, depending on what you intend to use.
